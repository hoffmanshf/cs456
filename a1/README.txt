CS 456 - Assignment #1 README

About:
The files: client.py and server.py are Python scripts written to fulfill the requirements outlined in Assignment #1

Compilation:
Since the programs are written in Python, there is no need to compile them; because of this, there is no makefile included with the submission. As outlined on Piazza, the marks for the makefile will be distributed across comments and code style.

Execution:
To start the server, run: python server.py
To start the client, run: python client.py <server_address> <n_port> <msg>

Parameters:
<server_address>  The name/IP of the machine that the server is running on.
<n_port> 	  The negotiate port printed out by the sever on startup
<msg> 		  A string to be reversed by the server

Machines:
The programs were tested using a single  machine (ubuntu1204-002) on the Linux student environment.
